# R Assignment

Carter Newton

## General Orginization

- I have four main files 
  - File "Part1" contains all .RData files created during Part1 of the project and all .txt files for the chromosome files 
  - File "Part2" contains all .RData files created during Part2
  - File "original_files" contains the two .txt files that were supplied for this project
  - File "Extra" contains a ".gitignore" file, along with files from my peer review's
- Lastly, the .Rmd file "R_Assignment_Workflow" is an Rmarkdown file consisting of all the code I used during the span of this project and lays an outline on how to reproduce the project
